# SmartLock NDL project
This repository is a home to all code handling the backend server. The `final` (default) branch contains code adjusted for the Rapsberry Pi 4B 8GB version, with Pi Camera Module 2 attached.

## Testing
Branch `remote-server` is a fork of `final` that has `face_recognition.py` adjusted to use static images, where a new image is picked at random at each iteration of the face recognition loop.
